# Apress Source Code

This code accompanies [*Introducing JavaScript Game Development*](https://www.apress.com/9781484232514) by Graeme Stuart (Apress, 2017).

BE AWARE - the actual repository for this textbook is at: https://github.com/Apress/intro-javascript-game-dev.git

I may have changed the code or added additional files in this repository when I teach a course in Web Animation...
